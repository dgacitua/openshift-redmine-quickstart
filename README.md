**CURRENT VERSION ON THIS REPO:** Redmine 3.2.0

Redmine is a flexible project management web application. Written using Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database.

Redmine is open source and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2 (GPL).

## Running on OpenShift

Create an account at https://www.openshift.com

Create a Ruby 1.9 application with MySQL 5.1

	rhc app create redmine ruby-1.9 mysql-5.1

Make a note of the username, password, and host name as you will need to use these to login to the database.

Add this upstream Redmine quickstart repo

	cd redmine
	git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/dgacitua/openshift-redmine-quickstart.git
	git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master

Then push the repo upstream

	git push

That's it, you can now checkout your application at:

	http://redmine-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com


Use the following to login to your new Redmine application running on OpenShift:

	username: admin
	password: admin


## Changing the default admin password

Once your installation is complete, it is highly recommended that you change the password for the Redmine admin user - see the Change password link at:

	http://redmine-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com/my/account
